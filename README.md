# Automobile Mileage EDA 🚗

### 📘 Overview
This project explores how various automobile parameters — such as weight, engine power, number of cylinders, and transmission type — influence vehicle mileage (fuel efficiency).  

It includes:
- A row,cleaned dataset
- A Jupyter notebook with analysis & visualizations
- Exported visuals (PNG/PDF)
 ### 📁 Files Overview
- [Dataset Folder](./data)
- [EDA Notebook](./notebook/AUTOMOBILE_MILEAGE_EDA.ipynb)
- [Visualizations](./visualization)

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on vehicle mileage dataset.
- Identify key factors influencing fuel efficiency.
- Suggest meaningful features for machine learning modeling.

### 🔍 Key Insights
- Vehicle **weight** and **engine power** show strong negative correlation with mileage.  
- **Manual transmissions** provide ~5–10% better fuel efficiency.
